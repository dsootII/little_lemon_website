# Capstone Project for Meta Front End Specialisation

This is the source code for a mock website for a fictional restaurant called Little Lemon Mumbai. This has been created for the Meta Front End Specialization on Coursera. 

NOTE: Only the reserve-a-table functionality works on the website as of now (as was the requirement for the course), but overtime, for practice, I plan to build the other pages as well.
